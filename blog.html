			<p id="blog1" class="blog"> Identifying new trustees for your board of directors is one of the most important functions any nonprofit board performs. And with nearly 2 million board seats opening up in this country every year, board recruiting can be challenging. For that reason, many nonprofits opt to turn to board recruiting services like BoardAssist for help. Choosing the best board recruiting service for your nonprofit is critical. What questions should you be asking as you think through who will perform the very important function of board recruiting for you?  <br> <br>			 

			<span class="boldspan"> 1. Is the service a nonprofit 501c3 itself? </span><br><br> 

			Many services are not.  Ones that aren’t 501c3 nonprofits might provide a terrific service but their primary purpose may not be to serve the nonprofit community.  Where does their money come from? At BoardAssist, a large part of our funding come from nonprofit foundations who value how we support their grantees.  Is the service you are evaluating paid by a corporation to place their employees on boards?  Does this create the wrong incentives?  Instead of focusing on finding you the perfect board member, are they focused on placing their client’s employees.  BoardAssist views their client as the nonprofit.  For-profit services often view someone else (such as the company paying them) as their client and as such, their primary focus will be on serving someone other than you. <br><br>

			<span class="boldspan"> 2. Is the service based in the city where you are located?</span><br><br>

			The nonprofit business is certainly global in the 21st century, and while a service located in a different city than where your board meets might be terrific, we believe there is no way they can have the candidate base knowledge, access and expertise a well-established local player would have. BoardAssist has over 20,000 NYC candidates in our database.  We thinks its important to work with the service that knows, and can deliver for you, the top candidates in your city.<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">3. How long has the service been in existence?</span><br><br>

			BoardAssist has been serving the nonprofit community since early 2001.  Across the US there are a number of services that have been helping our community for even longer. Younger services may try to make it appear they have been in the board search business longer than they have.  One quick check is to look up the principals on LinkedIn.  Do they list 2 jobs during the same time period? Perhaps they had another full time job while building their new board matching service so they haven’t really been in this space full time as long as you might have thought. Is board recruiting a new service that an older organization has just begun providing?  How long have they actually been doing board recruiting in your city?<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">4. What are the credentials of the individuals who will be performing your search?</span><br><br>

			Board recruiting is a challenging task.  Its important to find a service that will designate someone you fully trust to perform for you and your board. Look up the person who will be working on your search on LinkedIn. Don’t settle for just reviewing the bio that service’s website provides. Do they have board search experience? Or just nonprofit sector or governance experience generally?  BoardAssist’s Executive Director has been in the search space since 1995.<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">5. Does the service publish their rates online?</span><br><br>

			Many services choose to negotiate their board recruiting fees on a case by case basis.  Are you confident you are paying the same rate as others who have used that service?  What reason does the service give for not being fully transparent and publishing their rates online?</span><br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">6. Does the service track how their candidates have performed once recruited for a board?</span><br><br>

			BoardAssist surveys annually to see how our candidates are performing.  Have they stayed on the board where placed?  Have they met their financial commitment?  Over half our placements serve for at least 5 years with over 90% serving as leaders within 12 months of being placed.  And the majority generate a multiple of what they financially pledged with our average candidate generating over $75,000 for the board he/she joins.  Does the service you are considering track metrics such as these and others that are important to you?<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">7. Does the service provide a relatively comprehensive list of past nonprofits they have helped?</span><br><br>

			Is the service fully transparent in disclosing who they have supported in the past?  Or do they provide a short sample of some boards they have helped?  What reason do they give if they won’t provide a full historical client list? Is the client list specific as to who they have helped with board recruiting, or does it include nonprofits the service has helped with board trainings and other services? <br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">8. How involved is the service beyond simply identifying candidates for you? </span><br><br>

			Some services simply list your board opening on their website.  Do they screen candidates to ensure they meet the board requirements you have specified (including being able to meet  the financial commitment expected annually)?  Do they stay involved once they identify a candidate for you, making sure the interview process is moving along?  Do they help you “close” the candidate when you get to the offer stage ensuring that the time your board spent with the candidate leads to a successful nomination?<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">9. Is board matching the primary service this provider offers? </span><br><br>

			There are loads of terrific nonprofit support services that offer a wide range of services to the nonprofit community.  At BoardAssist, our sole focus is supporting the nonprofit community with board member recruitment.  If the service you are considering also focuses on candidate training, board mediations, and development work, for example, how much of their expertise is really in board development? What percentage of their time do they spend on board recruiting?<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">10.  Will the service allow you to work with other board recruiting services simultaneously? </span><br><br>

			Board recruiting is tough.  Your nonprofit needs to use every resource it can to find the best possible new trustees for your team.  We believe strongly that our top priority should be to ensure that your needs are met.  If there is an additional service you can use while also working with BoardAssist, we encourage working with them as well.  Board matching services that have your best interests at heart should feel the same way.<br><br>

			<li id="blog2li" class="bloglist"> <h2>Why Joining a Board is Great for Your Career</h2> </li>

			<p id="blog2" class="blog"> We know our blog readers are interested in “being the change” they want to see in the world and giving back, but sometimes its hard to find time to do just that with all the demands from work. Our argument for making time: joining a board is great for your career.  You’ll have a chance to be an agent of change and give back, but also do yourself a great service. For more on why, see what this week’s guest blogger Alyssa Gelbard had to say. <br><br>

	

			You’ve heard that a board role can be highly beneficial for your career. You’ve been told that whether it’s for a non-profit organization or corporate entity, serving on a board can provide professional growth opportunities and strengthen your personal brand. However, since pursuing a board role may require a considerable investment of time and effort – is the payoff worth it? Yes, because a board position enables professional development and personal growth, ultimately fueling career advancement. Here are some ways a board position can help you:<br><br>

			 

			<span class="boldspan">Strengthen your professional credibility </span><br><br>

			Selection for a board position shows that an organization is entrusting you with a vital, visible and high-impact role. It is a public endorsement of your expertise and value. This affiliation is one you can communicate and promote, and it can raise your professional profile among your peers, within your organization and across your industry. Your board affiliation can also enhance the brand and reputation of the organization for which you work. All of these things can help strengthen your candidacy for a promotion or new role and can increase your value in the workplace.<br><br>

			 

			<span class="boldspan">Grow your professional network</span><br><br>

			Board roles provide you with an incredible opportunity to meet influential, intelligent and well-connected people. You may meet an organization’s strategic partners, its clients and investors, as well as colleagues and leaders across industries and government. As you meet new people, be sure to connect in meaningful ways; relationships are not built on a single conversation. Cultivate them by setting up calls/meetings, sharing resources, making plans to meet at another event, and of course, connecting on LinkedIn. These relationships can be quite valuable when you are ready to pursue the next step in your career.<br><br>

			 

			<span class="boldspan">Sharpen your professional skills</span><br><br>

			Serving on a board will enable you to strengthen a variety of professional skills, which are highly beneficial for career advancement. Key among them is collaboration, particularly how you work and interact with other board members and organizational leaders across business and functional areas that may be newer to you.<br><br>

			 

			You also may hone your ability to contribute to an organization’s strategic direction, rather than managing day-to-day operations. Boards help to guide an organization broadly, such as improving its financial health or market competitiveness. You may be involved in organizational investments, performance evaluation, program funding and policy creation. This is a great step up if your career-to-date has been focused on overseeing a single functional area like finance, marketing or operations.<br><br>

			 

			Serving on a board will also strengthen leadership skills, especially if you are heading a committee of other executives, which is quite different than leading a team of direct reports or a cross-functional project team. And, if the committee meets remotely, directing them can also sharpen remote team management skills.<br><br>

			 

			A board position may also provide you with an opportunity to coach and mentor others, including members of the organization’s management team or junior board colleagues. In addition, specific training or certifications may be required as part of your board commitment. This will add to your professional wheelhouse and can be beneficial as you advance your career in any capacity.<br><br>

			 

			<span class="boldspan">Gain exposure and insight </span><br><br>

			Serving on a board provides access to the inner workings of an organization, as well as the opportunity to learn about other industries, business strategies and markets from an insider’s perspective. This exposure enhances your marketability and can be especially beneficial if you choose to pursue a role in a different industry or want to transition to a non-profit organization. If you are serving on a non-profit board, the role can lay the groundwork for potential leadership positions in that organization or similar ones in the future.<br><br>

			 

			<span class="boldspan">Reinvigorate your career </span><br><br>

			You can use your expertise and skills as a board member to make a difference in a company, industry, community, and possibly, in a lot of individual lives – especially if you work with a non-profit organization. And collaborating with and mentoring passionate and motivated people can also be invigorating. The resulting inspiration, connection and engagement can motivate and propel you to take your career to the next level.<br><br>

			 

			<span class="boldspan">Increased visibility</span><br><br>

			Exhibiting solid performance on a board and utilizing your expertise to contribute meaningfully to its mission and goals will elevate your professional reputation. You will be seen as a dedicated, strategic, go-to person with great insight who gets things done. Your visibility and value within the organization and with stakeholders and other business leaders will grow. These leaders, as well as your board colleagues, will know the benefits of working with you firsthand, which can be to your advantage as you pursue future board roles or employment opportunities.<br><br>

			 

			Serving on a board is a great way to expand your career experience, whether you’re helping a non-profit organization or a corporate entity. It will provide you with opportunities to broaden and sharpen skills, grow your professional network and gain exposure to new industries and areas of business that will drive professional growth. Joining a board will help you elevate your reputation and strengthen your personal brand, which are key elements to fuel career advancement.<br><br>

			<li id="blog3li" class="bloglist"> <h2>Not Sure Why Your Nonprofit Needs a Junior Board?  Here's Some of Our Top Reasons Why You Do!</h2> </li>

			<p id="blog3" class="blog">  Last fall BoardAssist launched a junior board matching pilot program to find junior boards for all the terrific millennials who approach us for board service. The pilot was an immediate success with loads of amazing young professionals approaching us for junior board seats. From the nonprofits we helped, the feedback has been extremely positive.  While many were concerned that having a junior board would take a lot of staff time away from other critical functions, what we’ve heard has been wholly to the contrary. Millennials are terrific self-starters that don’t need or want a lot of hand-holding.  Give them a task to do, and they will get it done! <br><br>

			Still on the fence about starting a junior board for your nonprofit? We wrote this post to share with you some of the amazing things our own Young Professionals Board has accomplished for us in their first six months of service.  We couldn’t be more grateful to them for their energy and all they have done.<br><br>

			For advice on managing your junior board with a minimal amount of time, read our Top 9 Tips for Managing Your Junior Board.  And now, read below for details on some of the many ways our own millennial board members have supported BoardAssist.<br><br>

			6 Terrific Ways our Young Professionals Board (YPB) has Supported Us<br><br>
			 

			<span class="boldspan">1. Google AdWords </span><br><br>

			As most nonprofits now know, Google generously gives qualifying nonprofits up to $120,000 a year to spend in free advertising.  But spending this free ad money is not easy unless you really know your way around Google AdWords.  For many smaller nonprofits like BoardAssist, that don’t have large social media and tech teams, figuring our how to use this money proves challenging, and its disheartening to leave this valuable gift unspent. BoardAssist’s YPB took on the task of spending this money for us with creative and well-placed ads and we are now spending a much higher percentage of the money allocated to us.  In the last 30 days, Adwords accounted for 12% of sessions on the BoardAssist site, a major jump thanks to the YPB.<br><br>

			Are you a charity that offers free music education to inner city kids?  Maybe placing your ads so that buyers of orchestra tickets can find them would be a good idea?  Or placing ads near sports tickets sales if you are a youth sports nonprofit?  We don’t profess to have the answers, but our hunch is your new junior board would.<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">2.  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) </span><br><br>

			One of the first things our YPB organized for us was a free SEO audit.  We thought we understood how SEO worked, and mistakenly thought how quickly folks found us online was largely about having certain keywords and tags on our website.  In fact, the SEO audit identified a number of new and interesting ways for us to improve our sites’s visibility, almost all having to do with things we should be doing unrelated to our site.<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">3.  Sourcing Generous Donations </span><br><br>

			Without even being asked, our YPB has sourced a number of terrific donations for BoardAssist.  One YPB member sourced free digital advertising for us with two major publications worth over $10,000.  Another one arranged for free printing of our signature book on board service, Giving Back.<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">4.  Helping us Communicate in the year 2016 </span><br><br>

			Getting your nonprofit’s message out in 2016 requires a completely different set of skills and communications techniques than it did in 2006 or 1996.  In addition to being on top of the latest social media trends, basic document production needs to be different.  Operating a nonprofit in 2016 means knowing how to communicate with images as much as with words. Our YPB has updated a number of documents in our board recruiting arsenal to make them more user friendly and replaced heavy text with more images.<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">5.  Recruiting for our own Young Professionals Board and Raising our Visibility Generally </span><br><br>

			Millennials are terrific at networking and team-building.  Our YPB grew themselves from zero to 12 professionals in no time flat.  While BoardAssist initially sourced candidate ideas for the team, our YPB interviewed and successfully closed these candidates wholly on their own. They also organized from start to finish several social events promoting BoardAssist – from finding spaces to host events for free, and creating and distributing Paperless Post invitations, to creating buzz for the events through multiple social media outlets, all at no cost to BoardAssist of staff time or money.  YPB events have all been 100% self funding.<br><br>

			<span class="boldspan">6. Creating Valuable New Partnerships </span><br><br>

			One of the top priorities for our YPB is finding more folks who want to serve on junior boards for our clients.  YPB members have been working enthusiastically to set up partnerships with the schools they attended and companies they work at to do just that. Millennials excel at collaborating.  Putting that skill to work for BoardAssist has been terrific.<br><br>

			 
			What are you waiting for?  Let BoardAssist help you build your own junior board.  If yours is half as productive and energetic as ours has been, you will be very pleased indeed.  <br><br>

			A final note:  while BoardAssist’s YPB is not engaged in fundraising for BoardAssist (as we don’t ask this of them), most junior boards are very involved in fundraising and enormously successful at it.<br><br>

			<p id="blog4" class="blog"> You asked.  We listened.  We hope you find our Top Ten Tips for Finding a Perfect Nonprofit Board useful.  For more on finding that perfect fit, download our free book, Giving Back, complete with case studies and answers to the FAQs we are asked most about board service.  Ready to join a board?  Tell us more so we can find you your dream board! <br><br>

			 
			Top Ten Tips for Finding a Perfect Nonprofit Board<br><br>
			 

			1. Find a nonprofit whose mission truly resonates with you.<br><br>

			Don’t compromise. With 1.8 million nonprofit board seats opening up in the United States every year, the demand is enormous. Hold out for something that is perfect for you!<br><br>

			2. Age matters.<br><br>

			Choose a nonprofit that’s the right age and budget for you. Do you want to join a startup or an established nonprofit that’s a household name? Do you want to work with an organization with 500 employees or just 5, where board members essentially function as staff?<br><br>

			3. Timing is everything.<br><br>

			How much time can you comfortably invest in board service? Find out where, when, and exactly how often your potential board meets – and if you can join by phone when you can’t attend in person.<br><br>

			4. Who’s on top?<br><br>

			Investigate board leadership and get a full bio of the Executive Director and the Board Chair. Don’t accept a board seat till you have met with both of them. Do you envision the time you’ll spend working together as enjoyable and rewarding?<br><br>

			5. Who else is on the board?<br><br>

			Do some additional research on your potential fellow board members. Where do they work? What are their areas of expertise? Would your skills be complementary and add something different to the board?<br><br>

			6. Find out why the board is adding at this time.<br><br>

			What’s the historic board turnover rate? Are members leaving because they can’t engage beyond raising capital? Are there personality conflicts? Find out!<br><br>

			7. Do I need a Roman numeral at the end of my name or have a trust fund to sit on this board?<br><br>

			What’s the expected financial commitment? Is it clear ($XX per year) or vague (members are asked to contribute something “personally significant)?” Decide what you’re comfortable with and don’t forget to factor in all the other pieces, including benefit tickets, journal ads, and capital campaigns.<br><br>

			8. Will I just be an ATM machine?<br><br>

			What, aside from fundraising, have board members done for the organization over the last three years? If your goal is to find a board that encourages and values engagement, ask for concrete examples. <br><br>

			9. My pocket or yours?<br><br>

			How does the financial commitment break down? Does the board mandate if your annual dues should be delivered on your own, or is there an expectation that you will be asked to generate donations from friends and colleagues? Is fundraising a comfortable role for you if it is indeed required?<br><br>

			10. Bring in the pros.<br><br>

			Consider working with a no-fee, nonprofit board matching service like BoardAssist, who can guide you through the process and ultimately help you make the right choice. For more tips on working with a nonprofit board matching service, see “How to Find the Perfect Nonprofit Board Matching Service.”<br><br>


			Serving on a nonprofit board can be an incredibly rewarding experience if you can engage and make a difference. For a full discussion of what to consider before joining a nonprofit board, download BoardAssist’s Giving Back and watch our recent nationally televised interview (below) discussing how easy it is to join a board with BoardAssist.<br><br>

			<li id="blog5li" class="bloglist"> <h2>Four Great Reasons to Join a Nonprofit Board</h2> </li>

			<p id="blog5" class="blog">Why should you consider filling one of the 1.8 million nonprofit board seats that open up in the US every year? Most candidates come to us with an answer to this question before we even ask. We hear, “My wife is pregnant and I want to model ‘giving back’ for our children,” “I was always a leader in college and grad school but until now I’ve been too busy to give back,” and “I feel an obligation to share because I’ve been so fortunate” among many other great reasons.<br><br>

			Four Great Reasons to Join a Nonprofit Board
			Once the decision has been made to give back in a substantive way, the next question for many becomes what is the best way to do so?  Most of our candidates feel as we do: there is no better return on your nonprofit time investment than through board service.<br><br>

			The impact our candidates have with two to three hours of board service a month is dramatically higher than what they could accomplish with two or three hours of direct service.<br><br>

			Consider this one example of many: a recent board placement reorganized her nonprofit’s services so they were able to save $450,000 a year, without cutting any employees’ jobs…with just a few hours of her time.  The amount of direct service this $450,000 will buy is staggering, and much greater than what this candidate’s direct service time would have accomplished. The “return on her time” was spectacular.<br><br>

			So what rewards and opportunities can you expect from joining a nonprofit board?<br><br>

			Maximize Your Impact<br><br>

			For most of our candidates, although they would enjoy teaching computer skills to an elderly person or reading skills to a young child, the truth is that the unique skills they bring to their work on a nonprofit board, in areas such as creating a strategic plan or reorganizing their nonprofit’s marketing or finances, are the grease that oils the nonprofit’s engines. It allows for the critical direct services to be delivered at maximum capacity.<br><br>

			Develop New Leadership Skills<br><br>

			There are invaluable skills you’ll acquire serving on a board. In fact, several of the New York’s top companies send us their professionals for board matching because they believe board service is a powerful leadership training tool for their employees. Sitting on any board, whether it’s corporate or nonprofit, can teach you a tremendous amount.<br><br>

			Help Build a Business<br><br>

			Nonprofits have management, marketing, public relations/communications, financial, strategic planning, tech, human resources and governance issues. Diving into any of these areas – understanding the concerns and making decisions that will impact a nonprofit – offers you a chance to have a very different role than you may have in your professional life. It’s a chance to develop new capabilities and grow a business (albeit a nonprofit one).<br><br>

			Grow Your Network<br><br>

			Serving on a board is also a wonderful way to meet people and expand your network. Whether it’s making new friends (and our candidates do become very close to their board colleagues) or meeting new clients – board service exposes you to other high impact New Yorkers who want to help the nonprofit community and be part of our city’s leadership.<br><br>


			Now that you have a stronger understanding of some of the reasons for joining a nonprofit board – what are you waiting for?  Apply today to join a nonprofit board representing a cause you care about, or learn more about the primary considerations when selecting a board.<br><br>

			<li id="blog6li" class="bloglist"> <h2>Volunteering vs. Serving on a Board vs. Donating. What Nonprofit Role is Best for You?</h2> </li>

			<p id="blog6" class="blog">As New York’s leading personalized nonprofit board matching service, BoardAssist is approached daily by New Yorkers who want to make a difference in the nonprofit world but don’t know how to get started. For many, the decision has been made to give back, but they aren’t sure if they want to do so by joining a board, or just volunteering, or simply being a generous donor. For others, they want to join a board but are unclear on what the difference is between a full governing board seat, an advisory board role or a junior board position.<br><br>

			We hope this week’s post explaining the many different ways folks can serve the nonprofit community will help you on your journey. Thanks for considering any of these roles – the nonprofit community needs you!<br><br>

			Volunteering vs. Serving on a Nonprofit Board vs. Donating - What Nonprofit Role is Best for You?<br><br>
			With so many ways to help the nonprofit community, which way is best for you? What follows is a discussion of some of the most common roles:<br><br>

			Serve as a Board Member<br><br>
			Serving as a board member is a terrific way to be an agent of change in the nonprofit community. Board members oversee every aspect of a nonprofit’s day to day existence, from programming to finance. What services should the nonprofit provide? Are they providing these services as affordably and effectively as they can? How much should staff at the nonprofit be paid?  Should the nonprofit consider entering into a strategic partnership with another nonprofit? Is the nonprofit located in a space that makes sense financially and from a programming point of view? Is the nonprofit communicating its message as optimally as possible? Is the nonprofit managing their volunteers in a way that makes them want to return? Are consumers of the nonprofit’s services satisfied? Is the nonprofit being managed in keeping with nonprofit best practices? Is the nonprofit behaving in a fiscally responsible and transparent way? These are just some of the questions that board members answer every day.<br><br>

			Key differentiating factor: the Executive Director works for the board of directors and serves at their pleasure.  Ultimately board members have tremendous responsibility and control over what goes on at the nonprofit on whose board they serve.<br><br>

			Serve as an Advisory Board Member<br><br>
			Serving on an advisory board means different things to different nonprofits. The key thing is that advisory board members advise vs. directing nonprofit staff. At some nonprofits, an advisory role can be very significant, but at other nonprofits advisory board members primarily fundraise and raise visibility for the nonprofit that they serve. They do not have oversight responsibilities. (Note: some folks mistakenly think an advisory board role will come with less of a financial obligation.  This is not always true. Double-check before committing!)<br><br>

			Key differentiating factor: advisory board members advise the nonprofit they serve, they do not have ultimate control over how the nonprofit acts.<br><br>

			Serve as a Junior Board Member<br><br>
			Junior board service usually entails a very similar role as serving as an Advisory Board Member. Young professionals fundraise and raise visibility for the nonprofits they serve but increasingly these millenials are also valued for the branding, communications, tech, design and marketing skills they have – especially since many nonprofits are not up to date on the latest and ever changing ways of getting their message out. Millenials are terrific at setting up new partnerships for the nonprofits they serve as well and often tapped for this role as well.<br><br>

			Key differentiating factor:  junior board members advise the nonprofit they serve, they do not have ultimate control over how the nonprofit acts.<br><br>

			Volunteer with a Nonprofit<br><br>
			Volunteering with a nonprofit can often be very meaningful for someone who wants to make a difference in the nonprofit world.  Many nonprofits are becoming much better at engaging their volunteers in very substantive ways. Whether you volunteer to serve at a soup kitchen or create a new website for a nonprofit, the right volunteer opportunity can be very satisfying.<br><br>

			Key differentiating factor:  volunteers do not have any oversight responsibilities and are not required to make a financial contribution to the nonprofit they serve (though many do).<br><br>

			Donate to a Nonprofit<br><br>
			Donors are the lifeblood of any nonprofit.  Nonprofits always need money to carry out the important work they do. While donors don’t necessarily exercise control over how a nonprofit functions, many donors will designate their dollars be used to a fund a specific program that is near and dear to that donor’s heart. For an individual interested in being an agent of change in the nonprofit world, there are certainly meaningful ways to make that happen even if your time is limited and hence your role is solely through giving.<br><br>

			Thank you! <br><br>                                                                                                                     Whatever role you choose on your nonprofit service path, we thank you for the time and energy you bring to the nonprofit you choose to support!<br><br>


			<li id="blog7li" class="bloglist"> <h2>Finding a Nonprofit Partner: Who is the Right One?</h2> </li>

			<p id="blog7" class="blog">There comes a moment in most nonprofits’ lives where they realize it might be helpful to collaborate with a partner on anything from programming to sharing back-office expenses to a full out merger. But once this determination has been made, many nonprofits are stumped as to how to find that critical partner.  This week’s guest blogger Stephanie Spindell has the answers for us. Thanks Stephanie! <br><br>

			Finding a Nonprofit Partner: Who is the Right One?<br><br>

			In order to understand the incidence and success of formal nonprofit collaborations, The Bridgespan Group and The Lodestar Foundation collaborated in a 2014 research study. Among the many findings, the study revealed that the number one barrier to collaborations (defined as associations, joint programs, shared support functions and mergers) expressed by CEOs was “identifying potential partners.”<br><br>

			Nevertheless, consider this: If a nonprofit CEO is struggling with ways to streamline costs, or deliver more services with greater impact and funding, collaboration should be prime on the mind.<br><br>

			The process of researching and selecting potential partners is not a difficult exercise but requires adequate sector experience, time, and resources. Nonprofits could handle this internally however many executives are faced with constraints on their time as they carry out their day to day responsibilities.  Hence many CEOs turn to independent consultants and consulting firms for help.<br><br>

			What about the funders’ roles in this process? According to the Bridgespan study, funders “need to tread cautiously” when recommending partners because they would not want their word to be taken as “dictate.” A discussion of grantmakers roles in supporting collaborations and other forms of capacity building are best left for another post. (Refer to Grantmakers for Effective Organizations, “Strengthening Nonprofit Capacity”, for common ways grantmakers support capacity building along with benefits and limitations).<br><br>

			Regardless of whether you handle the process of researching potential partners internally or externally, here are several steps which can help you along the way:<br><br>

			1.   Conduct an organizational assessment and environmental scan. If your organization is in tip top shape, this exercise should be relatively easy, however when major changes have recently occurred, such as the loss of a major funder or departure of an executive, an assessment becomes crucial. Objectivity is key. When executives finally come to the collaboration table, both sides need to be prepared to accentuate their strengths as well as explain or defend weaknesses.<br><br>

			Questions to answer in an assessment include:<br><br>

			What purpose does your nonprofit serve?<br><br>
			Why is your organization unique? What are your competitive advantages?<br><br>
			What are your program or other strengths, weaknesses?<br><br>
			How adequate are your resources and board in delivering your mission effectively and efficiently?<br><br>
			What is your financial condition? (See step 5 for more).<br><br>
			What external elements affect your sector, market, demographic?<br><br>
			2.  Determine partner criteria. Mission, vision and value relatedness are important criteria to consider for any nonprofit considering an alliance. By focusing on what’s driving the collaboration and/or what potential benefit is sought from it, executives can pinpoint other “must haves”. Examples include: Program depth and breadth, staff adequacy, demographics, board/funder representation and financial stability.<br><br>

			3.  Compose a list of nonprofits through internet research. If there’s an existing nonprofit with which you currently have a relationship, research it further. The Foundation Directory Online, The National Center for Charitable Statistics and Guidestar are all useful databases for researching other nonprofits similar to yours. Individual nonprofit websites will assist in further research efforts, however, financial performance data is generally omitted, but it should not be overlooked.<br><br>

			4.  Evaluate each nonprofit on the list and determine the best candidates. Further evaluation can be conducted on each partner after step 5) and once both sides have agreed to meet for the first time. In addition, areas which cannot be easily gleaned from publicly available information, such as culture fit and board-management relationship can then be gauged.<br><br>

			5.  Conduct a financial analysis of each nonprofit (and of your organization). This will aid in identifying any financial weakness, which depending on the severity, may force you to discard a candidate from the list. In addition, this analysis may be useful for partner meetings down the road in which major concerns may be voiced.  Partners can be compared to one another electronically through Guidestar’s Nonprofit Financial Scan product or with the help of a financial analyst.<br><br>

			A financial analysis is typically a summary of key organizational financial data from the most recent 5 years of the Form 990, including calculations of growth rates, profitability, liquidity and asset ratios. Specific areas to evaluate are: signs of unmanageable financial problems, negative trends, or anomalies. Cash reserves or special assets, which could be utilized in a potential alliance, should also be noted.<br><br>

			Conducting collaborator research and assessments can no doubt be time consuming and disruptive for nonprofits.  However, with pressures CEOS face in demonstrating organizational and program sustainability and greater impact, conducting collaboration research is essential to facilitate these goals.<br><br>

			<p id="blog8" class="blog"> We’ve updated one of our most popular blog posts because Google has updated their process. Thanks so much to Nonprofit Hub for writing this post and keeping us all current on the latest regarding this terrific free gift from Google! This post originally appeared on the Nonprofit Hub website. <br><br> 

			How to Use Google AdWords to Get Free Money<br><br>

			Free money doesn’t exist, but thanks to Google, free advertising can exist for your nonprofit.<br><br>

			As a part of Google Grants, qualifying nonprofits can earn a free advertising budget of up to $10,000 each month to use on AdWords to help promote their website and cause.<br><br>

			This is an easy program that your nonprofit can take part in to help raise its profile and reach a wider audience. You will have to jump through a few hoops, but nothing that should cause any stress or add much work to your daily life.<br><br>

			Application<br><br>

			The first step is to sign up for Google Grants at www.google.com/nonprofits. They have several requirements for a nonprofit to be eligible to be part of the program. First, your nonprofit must hold a current and valid charity status, which means you are a recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)3 organization. You need to agree to Google’s non-discrimination policies and its terms to how the grant will be received and used. Finally, you also need to have a website that is functioning and provides information about your nonprofit.<br><br>

			Even if your organization is considered tax-exempt, like churches, it still must receive 501(c)3 status from the IRS to qualify for Google Grants. Certain organizations are not eligible including governmental entities, hospitals or health care organizations and schools, academic institutions or childcare centers (They may be eligible for Google’s education program.)<br><br>

			If your organization meets those qualifications, submit your application to Google for review. You will receive quick acceptance/denied to the program. Once you are inside, you can enroll in a variety of programs such as Apps, Earth Pro, Maps API for Business, One Today and the YouTube Nonprofit Program. However, we are going to focus on Google AdWords for the remainder of the article.<br><br>

			Using Google AdWords<br><br>

			Congrats! If you’ve made it this far, you’re ready to start making a difference with AdWords. You can now start using your Google Grant for good. The first choice you will have to make is if you want to use the full version of AdWords or AdWords Express.<br><br>

			The right choice depends on how much time you want to spend on the campaigns and how much customization you want from your ads. AdWords Express is the basic cookie cutter model. The management of the ads on AdWords Express is completely automated. It is the “set it and forget it” option. This works fine for people who don’t have a lot of extra time to get into the minutia of the campaigns (which we cover below), but the results won’t be as great because the campaign settings are more generic. The other major difference is what your ads look like. AdWords Express limits ads to text only while AdWords allows text, banners and video.<br><br>

			Both programs only require you to pay for the clicks you receive and put their ads on Google Search and Google Maps, as well as mobile devices. In addition, you can target ads based on geography no matter which one you choose. Also, the ads you make must link to the website that you used in the application and the ads must also reflect the mission of your nonprofit, meaning you can sell products through the ads, but the proceeds must support your program. The ads are also limited to your website, so you can’t send people to link-heavy pages or display ads from Google AdSense.<br><br>

			No matter which one you choose, you will set up an advertiser account similar to people who are paying to advertise. To stay in the AdWords program, you will need to log in frequently (at least once a month) to update your account and make sure that everything is working like you want.<br><br>

			To start advertising, set a daily budget that will use up your budget in 31 days. You want to be sure to maximize your daily budget, because once the month is over, you don’t get to carry over any leftover amount to the next month. The first step is to select keywords that will trigger your ads when searched. (These words are selected for you if you choose AdWords Express) Words are valued at different rates for their cost-per-click, and you must choose words that do not exceed $2.00 per click. You’ll have to be creative because many words will be over your limit. A lot of the common phrases will cost more, but if you add a few more words onto the searches then the cost will drop significantly.<br><br>

			You can also add negative words that will prevent your ads from popping up when certain terms are searched. While this can be tempting, don’t waste too much of your budget. For example, if your nonprofit is focused on planting trees, you can use the negative word of “family” to filter out people searching for genealogy information.<br><br>

			You’ll need to find a balance between using all of your budget and using it in a way that yields productive results and is broad enough to capture an audience. Too broad and your searches won’t match your mission and desired audience, and too specific and you won’t get any hits and your budget is wasted. Monitor your account and see what searches are triggering your ads you’ll begin to figure out what words you need to include and also put on your negative list.<br><br>

			We’ve just covered the top level of these programs here. You can get quite deeper in the details once you have the basics down. Keep looking for new ways to get out there and promoting your nonprofit. It might take some time to figure out what will work for your nonprofit, but over time, you’ll start gaining traction with a whole new audience. And that’s OK. If you struggle to start, keep trying new words and what will be the most beneficial practices. You can’t truly fail because, after all, you are playing with house money.<br><br>
